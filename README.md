# GitHub Transfer
GitHub Transfer is a python script that allows you to transfer repositories from one GitHub account to another.

# Using GitHub Transfer
To use GitHub Transfer, install a recent version of python from `https://www.python.org/downloads/` and open up a command line.
In the command line, run `python --version` and make sure in the second version number it is version 3. It should say something along the lines of: `Python 3.10.0`.
Then run `python main.py fromUsername toUsername token` with `fromUsername` being the username of the account you are transfering from, `toUsername` being the name of the account you are transfering to and token being the "to" account's personal access token. If you don't have a personal access token, read this page to create one: `https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token`.
