# Contributing
Thanks for contributing to GitHub Transfer!

## How to contribute
To contribute a change to GitHub Transfer, make sure to follow these guidelines:
* Code must be in camelCase
* Code must have proper comments to document the change or comments throughout the code to explain any changes \
That's it! You may use any code style that is relatively close to the current code style, but this is not enforced.

## What you will need
* A recent install of python. On Windows, you can do this from the Windows store, but on other platforms you will need to download it from the website at `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
* All of the packages from `requirements.txt`. You can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
